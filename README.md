# Thrillshare

Apptegy plans to offer its school users a gift delivery service. The gifts will be school-branded and
sent to members of the school community through a dedicated section on Thrillshare, our core
product. Apptegy will create the item in-house and send it out for delivery. All the user has to do
within Thrillshare is essentially choose the gift, select the recipient(s), and confirm the order.

## Requirements

Things you need installed:

* Ruby version, `2.7.2`
* Rails version, `6.0.3`
* `Postgresql` installed

## Steps to install the project:

`git clone git@github.com:Mildred14/thrillshare.git`
* Install dependencies 
`bundle install`

```
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```
* Run server
